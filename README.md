# Mad-Libs-Generator-Game

This is a python project developed using the basic concept of python and tkinter. The objective of this project is to develop a Mad Libs Generator python project. In this project, the user first has to pick a story by the title of the story. Then the user has to enter specific words like a noun, adverb, verb, food, adjective, etc, according to the requirements. And then the story will be generated.

History : 
Mad Libs was invented in 1953 by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. Stern and Price co-created the game, but could not agree on a name for their invention. No name was chosen until five years later (1958), when Stern and Price were eating Eggs Benedict at a restaurant in New York City. While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighbouring table between a talent agent and an actor. According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the actor said that he wanted to “ad-lib” an upcoming interview. The agent, who clearly disagreed with the actor's suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing an interview would be"mad".Stern and Price used that eavesdropped conversation to create, at length, the name "Mad Libs". In 1958, the duo released the first book of Mad Libs, which resembled the earlier games of consequences and exquisite corpse.

Mad libs generator is a fun game that is usually played by kids.

In this python game user has to enter substitutes for blanks in the story without knowing the story. It will be fun to read aloud the stories after filling the blanks.


Steps to develop Mad Libs Generator Game 

Project Prerequisites:
Tkinter is a GUI Python library used to build GUI applications in the fastest and easiest way. To install the library, you can use the pip install command in command line: >pip install tkinter

Project File Structure:
These are the required steps to build Mad Libs generator python project:
* 	Import modules
* 	Create a display window
* 	Define functions
* 	Create buttons

1. Import Modules:
The first step to build a project is to import the required modules. In this project, we import tkinter module (from tkinter import *).

2. Create a Display Window:
* Tk() initialized tkinter which means window created.
* geometry() used when we want to set the width and height of the window.
* title() used to give the title of the window.
* Label() widget use to display text that users can’t able to modify.
* root is the name which we give to our window.
* text takes the text we want to display on the label.
* font used to set the size and type of fonts.
* pack organized widget in block.
* place() used when we want to place widgets in a specific position.


3. Define Function:

* input() field takes the input from the user.
* print() will print the text given in it.

4. Create Buttons:
Button() widget used to display buttons on our tkinter window command is called when the button is click and it is used to call the function.
root.mainloop() used when we want to run our program.

Summary:

We have successfully developed the mad libs generator python project. We used tkinter library for rendering graphics on a display window and learn how to create buttons widget and pass the function to the button. In this way, we build this python project.
